# ML-Risk-Analytics
Machine Learning in Credit Risk Analytics

Welcome to the ML Risk Analytics GitHub repository, where data meets strategic financial decision-making. This repository is centered around a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that explores the nuances of cleaning, processing, and analyzing data to predict the probability of defaultâ€”a key metric in risk management and financial analysis.

## Repository Features:
Data Preparation: Emphasizes the critical importance of data cleaning and preprocessing to set a strong foundation for predictive modeling.
Feature Engineering Techniques: Demonstrates advanced methods for transforming raw data into features that can effectively capture and represent the underlying patterns related to credit risk.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Focuses on the use of logistic regression to estimate the probability of default. The model's performance is evaluated through training, validation, and testing accuracies, providing a robust framework for comparison.

## Model Evaluation Tools
Accuracy Visualization: Helps in assessing the overall effectiveness of the model.

Confusion Matrix: Offers a detailed view of the model's performance in terms of false positives and negatives.

Classification Report: Summarizes the precision, recall, and F1-score of the model.

ROC Curve: Visualizes the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in the binary classification model to assist in determining the optimal model threshold.

## Purpose of the Repository:
This repository is designed to serve as an educational resource for individuals interested in the application of machine learning in risk analytics, particularly in the context of financial services. It provides a practical guide on how to approach and solve risk prediction problems, with the ultimate goal of calculating expected losses more accurately.
